        <h3>Merged offers selection</h3>
        <p>By default, the workspace offer aggregation uses the latest merged offer from each workspace</p>
        <p>If a workspace has troubles providing a coherent offer, you can here select a specific offer to be used
        during aggregation. This selection will remain in place upon further action from your part.</p>
